Unit 1 Project : CalorieCount

Why this Project?

I struggled to land on one project. I wanted to do something that was both fun and practical upon which I could expand when we learned more. I was unable to go with my first or second idea because of API issues and pivoted to this project fairly early in the project cycle.Although this was a hard pivot, I believe that the project ended up being both of the things I sought: fun and practical. To some degree I feel as though this project was a game of immitation. I wanted to take ideas from apps that already allowed food logging, and implement those from memory while testing the limits of my current knowledge.

Process:

I decided to set up a shell css early in the development process. Doing so allowed for me to see my functionality in real time. Doing so gave me a visual feedback that was necessary for success. Once the foundation of the basic layout was secure, I focused on completing bits and pieces of my javascript to continue the feedback loop. If I ran into issues, I fixed those issues before moving on.

Working through the javascript was both easier and harder than I expected it to be. When setting up the ability to pull from the API and store values of searchable content, I was able to set this up with little effort or time consumption. The stretch goals I set for myself were a massive time sync that expanded my understanding of what I already knew, and expanded upon that ten fold. Diving into local storage was a unique teacher in understanding the importance of data type. I was unable to access and alter my data while in string form so I was forced to convert the strings into objects, back into strings, back into objects, and back into strings in order to achieve fully functional storage and logging. The key takeaway from this project was that I still have a long way to go to create fully functioning web sites.
